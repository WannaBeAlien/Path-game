The program implements the 'Path' game, where the goal is to move the game piece from one side to the other as quickly as possible and with a minimal number of moves. 
The game logic is implemented using the base code and has not been modified. The movable pieces are implemented as push buttons and are connected with coordinates on a map. 
The coordinates are used to execute the move method found in the base code.

A piece cannot be moved if there is another piece of a different color in its 'path.' Pieces can only move vertically or horizontally. 
The game is won when the colors have swapped positions from the initial state. If a piece has space, it can move indefinitely with a single move, for example, from one end of the board to the other.

Additional features:

Pause button: Pauses the game and deactivates the game pieces. It changes to a resume button to continue the game.
